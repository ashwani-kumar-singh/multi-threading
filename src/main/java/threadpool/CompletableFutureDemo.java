/**
 * CompletableFuture is a class in java.util.concurrent package that implements the Future and CompletionStage
 * Interface. It represents a future result of an asynchronous computation.
 * It can be thought of as a container that holds the result of an asynchronous operation that is being executed in
 * a different thread. It provides a number of methods to perform various operations on the result of the async
 * computation.
 * <p>
 * Static methods "runAsync" and "supplyAsync" allow us to create a CompletableFuture instance out of Runnable
 * and Supplier functional types correspondingly.
 * If we do not pass executor it will by default use fork join executor pool.
 * It provide an instance of the Supplier as a lambda expression that does the calculation and returns the result.
 * <p>
 * "thenAccept" ->Ths method is the end part of staging. thenAccept receives a Consumer and passes it the result of the computation. If we donâ€™t need to return
 * a value down the Future chain, we can use an instance of the Consumer functional interface.
 * <p>
 * "thenRun" -> if we neither need the value of the computation nor want to return some value at the end of the chain,
 * then we can pass a Runnable lambda to the thenRun method. In the following example, we simply print a line in the
 * console after calling the future.get().
 * <p>
 * thenApply() -> method of the CompletableFuture class to chain multiple Future tasks together. This
 * method takes a Function argument, which is applied to the result of the previous Future task, and returns a new
 * CompletableFuture that completes with the result of the function.
 * <p>
 * thenCombine() -> method of the CompletableFuture class to combine the results of two Future tasks.
 * This method takes another CompletableFuture and a BiFunction argument, which is applied to the results of both
 * Future tasks, and returns a new CompletableFuture that completes with the result of the function.
 * <p>
 * Difference Between thenApply() and thenCompose()
 * <p>
 * thenApply() -> We can use this method to work with the result of the previous call. However, a key point to
 * remember is that the return type will be combined of all calls. It uses same thread which completed previous
 * async task. It will not create any new thread for it's execution.
 * <p>
 * thenApplyAsync() -> These methods are usually intended for running a corresponding execution step in another thread.
 * In contrast, the Async method without the Executor argument runs a step using the common fork/join pool
 * implementation of Executor that is accessed with the ForkJoinPool.commonPool().
 * If multiple "thenApplyAsync" is used , ordering can not be guarantee, they will run concurrently.
 *
 * thenCompose() -> uses the previous stage as the argument. It will flatten and return a Future with the result directly,
 * rather than a nested future as we observed in thenApply().
 *
 * thenComposeAsync() -> uses the previous stage as the argument. the Async method without the Executor argument
 * runs a step using the common fork/join pool implementation of Executor that is accessed with the
 * ForkJoinPool.commonPool().
 * We bring some ordering for any async task using "thenComposeAsync".
 *
 * allOf() -> method of the CompletableFuture class to create a new CompletableFuture that will complete when all of
 * the specified Future tasks have completed.
 * <p>
 * exceptionally() -> method of the CompletableFuture class to specify a callback that will be executed if the
 * Future task completes exceptionally (i.e., if it throws an exception). This method takes a Function argument,
 * which is applied to the exception thrown by the task, and returns a default value to be used as the result of
 * the CompletableFuture.
 * <p>
 * handle() -> CompletableFuture class allows us to handle it in a special handle method. This method receives two
 * parameters: a result of a computation (if it finished successfully) and the exception thrown
 * (if some computation step did not complete normally).
 * we use the handle method to provide a default value when the asynchronous computation
 * of a greeting was finished with an error.
