/**
 * When using an Executor, we can shut it down by calling the shutdown() or shutdownNow() methods. Although, it
 * wonâ€™t wait until all threads stop executing.
 *
 * awaitTermination() -> Waiting for existing threads to complete their execution can be achieved by using the
 * awaitTermination() method.
 *
 * shutdown() -> method of ThreadPoolExecutor class initiates an orderly shutdown in which already submitted
 * task is accepted, but no new task is accepted.
 *
 * shutdownNow() -> method of ThreadPoolExecutor class attempts to stop all the tasks which are executing
 * actively, halts the processing of waiting tasks and returns a list of the tasks that were awaiting execution.
