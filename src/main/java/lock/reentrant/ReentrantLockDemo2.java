package lock.reentrant;

/**
 * The traditional way to achieve thread synchronization in Java  a thread can take a lock only once.
 * Synchronized blocks donâ€™t offer any mechanism of a waiting queue and after the exit of one thread,
 * any thread can take the lock. This could lead to starvation of resources for some other thread for
 * a very long period of time.
 * Reentrant Locks are provided in Java to provide synchronization with greater flexibility.
 *
 * As the name says, ReentrantLock allows threads to enter into the lock on a resource more than once.
 * When the thread first enters into the lock, a hold count is set to one. Before unlocking the thread
 * can re-enter into lock again and every time hold count is incremented by one. For every unlocks
 * request, hold count is decremented by one and when hold count is 0, the resource is unlocked.
