/**
 * Having a pair of read-write lock allows for a greater level of concurrency in accessing shared data than
 * that permitted by a mutual exclusion lock. It exploits the fact that while only a single thread at
 * a time (a writer thread) can modify the shared data, in many cases any number of threads can
 * concurrently read the data (hence reader threads).
 *
 * A read-write lock will improve performance over the use of a mutual exclusion lock if the frequency
 * of reads is more than writes, duration of the read operations is more than the duration of the
 * writes. It also depends on the contention for the data â€“ that is, the number of threads that will
 * try to read or write the data at the same time.
