/**
 * The internal implementation of CopyOnWriteArraySet is CopyOnWriteArrayList only.
 * a. Multiple Threads are able to perform update operations simultaneously but for every update operation,
 * a separate cloned copy is created.
 * b. As for every update a new cloned copy will be created which is costly.
 * Hence if multiple update operations are required then it is not recommended to use CopyOnWriteArraySet.
 * c. While one thread iterating the Set, other threads can perform updation, here we wonâ€™t get any runtime exception
 * like ConcurrentModificationException.
 * d. An Iterator of CopyOnWriteArraySet class can perform only read-only and should not perform the deletion,
 * otherwise, we will get Run-time exception UnsupportedOperationException.
 * e. Use CopyOnWriteArraySet in applications in which set sizes generally stay small, read-only
 * operations vastly outnumber mutative operations, and you need to prevent interference among threads
 * during traversal.
 * f. CopyOnWriteArraySet helps in minimizing programmer-controlled synchronization steps and
 * moving the control to inbuilt, well-tested APIs
